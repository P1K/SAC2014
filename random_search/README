Random search for systematic encoders of a geometric code over X: x^5 = y^2 + y on F_16
which minimise some cost function.

How to compile:

Fetch the SFMT PRNG and define its path in the Makefile
(See http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/index.html)
Install M4RI & M4RIE
(See http://m4ri.sagemath.org/)
Tune the CPPFLAGS to whatever you like (and your system/compiler supports)
Define the `LOGOMANY' preprocessor variable to the (base 2) log of your search space
Then make etc.
