# SAC2014
Search and implementation of diffusion matrices from algebraic-geometry codes

These programs were written for the SAC 2014 paper *Diffusion Matrices from Algebraic-Geometry Codes with Efficient SIMD Implementation*
(see `https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/551`).

They include:
1. A search for block matrices using the automorphisms of the curve/code.
2. A search for random matrices.
3. SSE (assembly) implementation of one matrix both over **F_2^4** and **F_2^8** and of companion toy ciphers.
